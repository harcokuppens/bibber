abstract = {In this paper we present type patterns: a notation for shape-carrying array types that enables the specification of dependent type signatures while maintaining flexibility and a high level of code readability. Similar notations pre-exist, but we extend them to support rank-polymorphism and specifications of arbitrarily complex constraints between values and types. Furthermore, we enable type patterns to double as a pattern matching mechanism against shapes and shape-components of array arguments, making those values directly available in the corresponding function bodies. While this notation could be used as a basis for a dependently typed language, in our prototypical implementation in the context of SaC we do not require all dependencies to be resolved statically. Instead, we follow a hybrid approach: we map the proposed type patterns into the pre-existing type system of SaC, and we generate additional constraints which we try to statically resolve as far as possible by means of partial evaluation. Any remaining constraints are checked at run-time. We outline our implementation in the context of the SaC ecosystem, and present several examples demonstrating the effectiveness of this hybrid approach based on partial evaluation.},

  abstract = {Concurrent separation logic has been responsible for major advances in the formal verification of fine-grained concurrent algorithms and data structures such as locks, barriers, queues, and reference counters. The key ingredient of the verification of a fine-grained program is an invariant, which relates the physical data representation (on the heap) to a logical representation (in mathematics) and to the state of the threads (using a form of ghost state). An invariant is typically represented as a disjunction of logical states, but this disjunctive nature makes invariants a difficult target for automated verification. Current approaches roughly suffer from two problems. They use backtracking to introduce disjunctions in an uninformed manner, which can lead to unprovable goals if an appropriate case analysis has not been made before choosing the disjunct. Moreover, they eliminate disjunctions too eagerly, which can cause poor efficiency. While disjunctions are no problem for automated provers based on classical (i.e., non-separating) logic, the challenges with disjunctions are prominent in the study of proof automation for intuitionistic logic. We take inspiration from that area{\textemdash}specifically, based on ideas from connection calculus, we design a simple multi-succedent calculus for separation logic with disjunctions featuring a novel concept of a connection. While our calculus is not complete, it has the advantage that it can be extended with features of the state-of-the-art concurrent separation logic Iris (such as modalities, higher-order quantification, ghost state, and invariants), and can be implemented effectively in the Coq proof assistant with little need for backtracking. We evaluate the practicality on 24 challenging benchmarks, 14 of which we can verify fully automatically.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in concurrent separation logic enabled the formal verification of increasingly sophisticated fine-grained (i.e., lock-free) concurrent programs. For such programs, the golden standard of correctness is linearizability, which expresses that concurrent executions always behave as some valid sequence of sequential executions. Compositional approaches to linearizability (such as contextual refinement and logical atomicity) make it possible to prove linearizability of whole programs or compound data structures (e.g., a ticket lock) using proofs of linearizability of their individual components (e.g., a counter). While powerful, these approaches are also laborious{\textemdash}state-of-the-art tools such as Iris, FCSL, and Voila all require a form of interactive proof. This paper develops proof automation for contextual refinement and logical atomicity in Iris. The key ingredient of our proof automation is a collection of proof rules whose application is directed by both the program and the logical state. This gives rise to effective proof search strategies that can prove linearizability of simple examples fully automatically. For more complex examples, we ensure the proof automation cooperates well with interactive proof tactics by minimizing the use of backtracking. We implement our proof automation in Coq by extending and generalizing Diaframe, a proof automation extension for Iris. While the old version (Diaframe 1.0) was limited to ordinary Hoare triples, the new version (Diaframe 2.0) is extensible in its support for program verification styles: our proof search strategies for contextual refinement and logical atomicity are implemented as modules for Diaframe 2.0. We evaluate our proof automation on a set of existing benchmarks and novel proofs, showing that it provides significant reduction of proof work for both approaches to linearizability.},

abstract = {Clinical and neuroscientific evidence indicates that
                  transdiagnostic processes contribute to the
                  generation and maintenance of psychopathological
                  symptoms and disorders. Rigidity (inflexibility)
                  appears a core feature of most transdiagnostic
                  pathological processes. Decreasing rigidity may
                  prove important to restore and maintain mental
                  health. One of the primary domains in which rigidity
                  and flexibility plays a role concerns the self. We
                  adopt the pattern theory of self (PTS) for a working
                  definition of self. This incorporates the pluralist
                  view on self as constituted by multiple aspects or
                  processes, understood to constitute a self-pattern,
                  i.e. processes organized in non-linear dynamical
                  relations across a number of time scales. The use of
                  mindfulness meditation in the format of Mindfulness
                  Based Interventions (MBIs) has been developed over
                  four decades in Clinical Psychology. MBIs are
                  promising as evidence-based treatments, shown to be
                  equivalent to gold-standard treatments and superior
                  to specific active controls in several randomized
                  controlled trials. Notably, MBIs have been shown to
                  target transdiagnostic symptoms. Given the
                  hypothesized central role of rigid, habitual
                  self-patterns in psychopathology, PTS offers a
                  useful frame to understand how mindfulness may be
                  beneficial in decreasing inflexibility. We discuss
                  the evidence that mindfulness can alter the
                  psychological and behavioral expression of
                  individual aspects of the self-pattern, as well as
                  favour change in the self-pattern as a whole
                  gestalt. We discuss neuroscientific research on how
                  the phenomenology of the self (pattern) is reflected
                  in associated cortical networks and
                  meditation-related alterations in cortical
                  networks. Creating a synergy between these two
                  aspects can increase understanding of
                  psychopathological processes and improve diagnostic
                  and therapeutic options.},

    abstract = {Model-based testing (MBT) promises a scalable solution to testing large systems, if a model is available. Creating these models for large systems, however, has proven to be difficult. Composing larger models from smaller ones could solve this, but our current MBT conformance relation uioco is not compositional, i.e. correctly tested components, when composed into a system, can still lead to a faulty system. To catch these integration problems, we introduce a new relation over component models called mutual acceptance. Mutually accepting components are guaranteed to communicate correctly, which makes MBT compositional. In addition to providing compositionality, mutual acceptance has benefits when retesting systems with updated components, and when diagnosing systems consisting of components.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) software is notoriously complex, conventionally comprising multiple tiers. Traditionally an IoT developer must use multiple programming languages and ensure that the components interoperate correctly. A novel alternative is to use a single tierless language with a compiler that generates the code for each component and ensures their correct interoperation.We report a systematic comparative evaluation of two tierless language technologies for IoT stacks: one for resource-rich sensor nodes (Clean with iTask) and one for resource-constrained sensor nodes (Clean with iTask and mTask). The evaluation is based on four implementations of a typical smart campus application: two tierless and two Python-based tiered.(1) We show that tierless languages have the potential to significantly reduce the development effort for IoT systems, requiring 70\% less code than the tiered implementations. Careful analysis attributes this code reduction to reduced interoperation (e.g., two embedded domain-specific languages and one paradigm versus seven languages and two paradigms), automatically generated distributed communication, and powerful IoT programming abstractions. (2) We show that tierless languages have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of IoT systems, describing how Clean iTask/mTask maintains type safety, provides higher-order failure management, and simplifies maintainability. (3) We report the first comparison of a tierless IoT codebase for resource-rich sensor nodes with one for resource-constrained sensor nodes. The comparison shows that they have similar code size (within 7\%), and functional structure. (4) We present the first comparison of two tierless IoT languages, one for resource-rich sensor nodes and the other for resource-constrained sensor nodes.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing fast. In 2018, there was approximately one connected device per person on earth and the number has been growing ever since. The devices interact with the environment via different modalities at the same time using sensors and actuators making the programs parallel. Yet, writing this type of programs is difficult because the devices have little computation power and memory, the platforms are heterogeneous and the languages are low level. Task Oriented Programming (TOP) is a declarative programming language paradigm that is used to express coordination of work, collaboration of users and systems, the distribution of shared data and the human-computer interaction. The mTask language is a specialized, yet full-fledged, multi-backend TOP language for IoT devices. With the bytecode interpretation backend and the integration with iTask, tasks can be executed on the device dynamically. This means that—according to the current state of affairs—tasks can be tailor-made at run time, compiled to device-agnostic bytecode and shipped to the device for interpretation. Tasks sent to the device are fully integrated in iTask to allow every form of interaction with the tasks such as observation of the task value and interaction with Shared Data Sources (SDSs). The entire IoT application—both server and devices—are programmed in a single language, albeit using two embedded Domain Specific Languages (EDSLs).},

	abstract = {High-level languages are often implemented by transforming them into a stack-based intermediate language. To ensure correctness of the implementation, it is desirable to have a type-system for the stack-based code that ensures that the required arguments are available on the stack. This is quite challenging since the stack contains values of mixed types. Moreover, a single stack is shared by all basic stack instructions and the functions implemented with those instructions. Just like basic instructions, function calls are expected to replace their arguments by the result and to leave the rest of the stack untouched. This paper shows a Domain-Specific Language, DSL, for stack-based computations embedded in strongly typed functional programming language. We use heterogeneous lists in the DSL to ensure that the top of the stack contains the required elements for instructions and functions. Type correctness of the composition of instructions and functions is ensured by requiring that the remainder of the stack is unchanged. However, standard typing restrictions impose that all function applications have identically typed arguments and hence an identical stack layout. We present a simple solution based on data types with universally quantified type variables. The resulting DSL supports multiple views and handles mutually recursive functions of arbitrary arities.},

title = "Bicategorical type theory: Semantics and syntax",
abstract = "We develop semantics and syntax for bicategorical type theory. Bicategorical type theory features contexts, types, terms, and directed reductions between terms. This type theory is naturally interpreted in a class of structured bicategories. We start by developing the semantics, in the form of comprehension bicategories. Examples of comprehension bicategories are plentiful; we study both specific examples as well as classes of examples constructed from other data. From the notion of comprehension bicategory, we extract the syntax of bicategorical type theory, that is, judgment forms and structural inference rules. We prove soundness of the rules by giving an interpretation in any comprehension bicategory. The semantic aspects of our work are fully checked in the Coq proof assistant, based on the UniMath library.",

  abstract  = {For many algorithms, it is challenging to identify a suitable parallel version, as the design space is typically very large. In this paper we demonstrate how rank-polymorphic array languages can be used as a tool to explore such design spaces through concise high-level specifications. If input data can be organised into a multi-dimensional array, and the algorithm can be stated as a recursive traversal over sub-arrays, array languages offer a lot of expressive power. The reason for this is that array shapes can be used to guide recursive traversals. Conciseness of specifications comes from array reshapes that move the desired elements into canonical hyperplanes. As a case study, we discuss several variants of implementing prefix sums (also known as scans) in SaC. We demonstrate how small code adjustments suffice to change the concurrency pattern exposed to the compiler. It turns out that variability that is typically achieved by generic inductive data types such as binary trees is a special case of what is offered by the array paradigm.},

  abstract  = {Data-Parallelism on multi-dimensional arrays can be conveniently specified as element-wise computations that are executed across n-dimensional index-spaces. While this at first glance matches very well the concept of n-dimensional thread-spaces as provided by the programming model of GPUs, in practice, a one-to-one correspondence often does not work out. This paper proposes a small set of combinators for mapping multi-dimensional index spaces onto multi-dimensional thread-index spaces suitable for execution on GPUs. For each combinator, we provide an inverse operation, which allows the original indices to be recovered within the individual threads. This setup facilitates arbitrary n-dimensional array computations to be executed on GPUs with arbitrary thread-space constraints provided the overall resources required for the computation do not exceed those of the GPU.},

 abstract = {We propose a new notation for data parallel operators on multi- dimensional arrays named tensor comprehensions. This notation combines the basic principle of array-comprehensions with syn- tactical shortcuts very close to those found in the so-called Tensor Notations used in Physics and Mathematics. As a result, complex operators with rich semantics can be defined concisely. The key to this conciseness lies in the ability to define shape-polymorphic operations combined with the ability to infer array shapes from the immediate context. The paper provides a definition of the pro- posed notation, a formal shape inference process, as well as a set of re-write rules that translates tensor comprehensions as a zero-cost syntactic sugar into standard SaC expressions.},

              Premenopausal bilateral ovariectomy is considered to be one of the risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate long-term neurological consequences of ovariectomy in a rodent AD model, TG2576 (TG), and wild-type mice (WT) that underwent an ovariectomy or sham-operation, using in vivo MRI biomarkers. An increase in osmoregulation and energy metabolism biomarkers in the hypothalamus, a decrease in white matter integrity, and a decrease in the resting-state functional connectivity was observed in ovariectomized TG mice compared to sham-operated TG mice. In addition, we observed an increase in functional connectivity in ovariectomized WT mice compared to sham-operated WT mice. Furthermore, genotype (TG vs WT) effects on imaging markers and GFAP immunoreactivity levels were observed, but there was no effect of interaction (Genotype x Surgery) on amyloid-beta-and GFAP immunoreactivity levels. Taken together, our results indicated that both genotype and ovariectomy alters imaging biomarkers associated with AD.}

 summary = {Compares different memory models in CUDA and describes code generation for them},
 abstract = { NVIDIA’s CUDA provides several options to orchestrate the management of host and device memory as well as the communication between them. In this paper we look at these choices, identify the program changes required when switching between them, and we observe their effect on application performance. We present code generation schemes that translate resource-agnostic program specifications, i.e., programs without any explicit notion of memory or GPU kernels, into five CUDA versions that differ in the use of the memory and communication API of CUDA only. An implementation of these code generators within the compiler of the functional programming language Single-Assignment C (SaC) shows performance differences between the variants by up to a factor of 3. Performance analyses reveal that the preferred choices depend on a combination of several factors, including the actual hardware being used, and several aspects of the application itself. A clear choice, therefore, cannot be made a priori. Instead, it seems essential that different variants can be generated from a single source for achieving performance portability across GPU devices.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) software stacks are notoriously complex, conventionally comprising multiple tiers/components and requiring that the developer not only uses multiple programming languages, but also correctly interoperate the components. A novel alternative is to use a single tierless language with a compiler that generates the code for each component, and for their correct interoperation.We report the first ever systematic comparison of tiered and tierless IoT software architectures. The comparison is based on two implementations of a non-trivial smart campus application. PRSS has a conventional tiered Python-based architecture, and Clean Wemos Super Sensors (CWSS) has a novel tierless architecture based on Clean and the iTask and mTask embedded DSLs. An operational comparison of CWSS and PRSS demonstrates that they have equivalent functionality, and that both meet the University of Glasgow (UoG) smart campus requirements.Crucially, the tierless CWSS stack requires 70\% less code than the tiered PRSS stack. We analyse the impact of the following three main factors. (1) Tierless developers need to manage less interoperation: CWSS uses two DSLs in a single paradigm where PRSS uses five languages and three paradigms. (2) Tierless developers benefit from automatically generated, and hence correct, communication. (3) Tierless developers can exploit the powerful high-level abstractions such as Task Oriented Programming (TOP) in CWSS. A far smaller and single paradigm codebase improves software quality, dramatically reduces development time, and improves the maintainability of tierless stacks.},

    abstract = "It was conjectured by Černý in 1964 that a synchronizing DFA on n states always has a shortest synchronizing word of length at most (n−1)2, and he gave a sequence of DFAs reaching this bound. In this paper, we investigate the role of the alphabet size. For each possible alphabet size, we count DFAs on n≤6 states which synchronize in (n−1)2−e steps, for all e<2⌈n/2⌉. Furthermore, we give constructions of automata with any number of states, and 3, 4, or 5 symbols, which synchronize slowly, namely in n2−3n+O(1) steps. In addition, our results prove Černý's conjecture for n≤6. Our computations lead to 31 DFAs on 3, 4, 5 or 6 states, which synchronize in (n−1)2 steps. Of these DFA's, 19 are new. The remaining 12, which were already known, are exactly the minimal ones. The 19 new DFAs are extensions of automata which were already known. But for n>3, we prove that the Černý automaton on n states does not admit non-trivial extensions with the same smallest synchronizing word length (n−1)2."

  abstract = 	 {We give an optimisation for active learning algorithms, applicable to learning Moore machines with decomposable outputs. These machines can be decomposed themselves by projecting on each output. This results in smaller components that can then be learnt with fewer queries. We give experimental evidence that this is a useful technique which can reduce the number of queries substantially. Only in some cases the performance is worsened by the slight overhead. Compositional methods are widely used throughout engineering, and the decomposition presented in this article promises to be particularly interesting for learning hardware systems.}

abstract="An n-complete test suite for automata guarantees to detect all faulty implementations with a bounded number of states. We propose a construction of such a test suite for ioco conformance on labeled transition systems, which we derive from construction methods for deterministic FSMs. Our resulting test suite poses no further restrictions on the implementations other than their number of states and fairness in test execution. This elevates restrictions made in existing methods. In particular, we address the problem of compatible states: specification states which can be implemented by a single state. Such states are forbidden by existing methods for ioco, as they complicate test suite construction.",

    ABSTRACT = "{Model-based testing is one of the promising technologies
                to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of software testing.
                This paper outlines the evolution of model-based testing based
                on labelled transition systems, from purely theoretical developments
                in the eighties to industrially applicable tools now:
                from canonical testers to practical testers.
                We present TorXakis as an example of a practical model-based tester,
                founded in the testing theory for labelled transition systems,
                and now being introduced in the daily practice of testing.}"

  abstract = {In this paper we present our vision on how the practice of Ontology
	could be used to support the integration of (conceptual) models capturing
	various different aspects of an enterprise, originating from different
	stakeholders. Creating an overall enterprise model (or architecture)
	requires a deep understanding not only of what the words used in
	models mean to their creators, but also how the various modelers
	interpret the meta-conceptual constructs they use (i.e. categories
	in the modeling language). We argue this cannot be achieved by assuming
	a priori consensus on the used semantics (as is common practice),
	but that we need to incorporate methods that let us discover the
	existing categorization tendencies of specialized discourse communities
	and their individual members. Thus, we propose that conceptual integration
	in enterprise modeling, and perhaps also in other fields, would strongly
	benefit from an approach to Ontology that is more concerned with
	figuring out how people actually categorize than with stipulating
	how they ought to categorize. To show the possibilities such an approach
	offers we describe how the semantic differential can be adapted to
	fit this need and demonstrate its application by investigating the
	categorization tendencies of some computing science students in regards
	to modeling notation constructs.},

	modelling is viewed here as `the goal-driven creation and shaping
	of models that are based on the principles of rational description
	and reasoning'. Our long term goal is to use analysis as a basis
	for improvement of collaborative modelling and the development of
	dedicated interactive support environments. We focus on a specific,
	established flavour of collaborative modelling called Group Model
	Building (GMB), rooted in System Dynamics. GMB is the collaborative
	modelling of causal relations and feedback loops, aiming for the
	understanding of the complex influences among system variables in
	some system. We discuss our theoretical approach to the systematic
	analysis and framing of collaborative modelling as dialogue games.
	We then present an evaluated prototype of a dialogue game for analysing
	GMB: an operational framing of constrained and guided GMB conversations.},

	that become obsolete. The inpact of such changes usually goes beyond
	the functionality of services alone. Sometimes it also affects the
	systems that are used to run the services, new networking procedures
	that need to be put in place, communication strategies that ne to
	be aligned, and business models that need to be reworked. To cope
	with such changes, organizations must be able to carry out the required
	changes as cost effective and efficient as possible. Besides constraints
	on the functionality of services itself, the ability to deal with
	these events also puts constraints on how to create services. This
	chapter presents the way of working to define, build, deploy and
	maintain services such that organizations can cope with changing

	with shared semantics in Enterprise Modeling. People tend to understand
	modeling meta-concepts (i.e., a modeling language's constructs or
	types) in a certain way and can be grouped by this understanding.
	Having an insight into the typical communities and their composition
	(e.g., what kind of people constitute a semantic community) would
	make it easier to predict how a conceptual modeler with a certain
	background will generally understand the meta-concepts he uses, which
	is useful for e.g., validating model semantics and improving the
	efficiency of the modeling process itself. We demonstrate the use
	of psychometric data from two studies involving experienced (enterprise)
	modeling practitioners and computing science students to find such
	communities, discuss the challenge that arises in finding common
	real-world factors shared between their members to identify them
	by and conclude that the common (often implicit) grouping properties
	such as similar background, focus and modeling language are not supported
	by empirical data.},

	introduce new services, adapt existing services, or phase out services
	that become obsolete. The inpact of such changes usually goes beyond
	the functionality of services alone. Sometimes it also affects the
	systems that are used to run the services, new networking procedures
	that need to be put in place, communication strategies that ne to
	be aligned, and business models that need to be reworked. To cope
	with such changes, organizations must be able to carry out the required
	changes as cost effective and efficient as possible. Besides constraints
	on the functionality of services itself, the ability to deal with
	these events also puts constraints on how to create services. This
	chapter presents the way of working to define, build, deploy and
	maintain services such that organizations can cope with changing
	business needs.},

  abstract = {We present a typical synergy between dynamic types (dynamics) and
	generalised algebraic datatypes (GADTs). The former provides a clean
	approach to integrating dynamic typing in a statically typed language.
	It allows values to be wrapped together with their type in a uniform
	package, deferring type unification until run time using a pattern
	match annotated with the desired type. The latter allows for the
	explicit specification of constructor types, as to enforce their
	structural validity. In contrast to ADTs, GADTs are heterogeneous
	structures since each constructor type is implicitly universally
	quantified. Unfortunately, pattern matching only enforces structural
	validity and does not provide instantiation information on polymorphic
	types. Consequently, functions that manipulate such values, such
	as a type-safe update function, are cumbersome due to boilerplate
	type representation administration. In this paper we focus on improving
	such functions by providing a new GADT annotation via a natural synergy
	with dynamics. We formally define the semantics of the annotation
	and touch on novel other applications of this technique such as type
	dispatching and enforcing type equality invariants on GADT values.},

	the automation of test generation and test execution. One obstacle
	to its adoption is the difficulty of developing models. Learning
	techniques provide tools to automatically derive automata-based models.
	Automation is obtained at the cost of time and unreadability of the
	models. We propose an abstraction technique to reduce the alphabet
	and large data sets. Our idea is to extract a priori knowledge about
	the teacher and use this knowledge to define equivalence classes.
	The latter are then used to define a new and reduced alphabet. The
	a priori knowledge can be obtained from informal documentation or
	requirements. We formally prove soundness of our approach. We demonstrate
	the practical feasibility of our technique by learning a model of
	the new biometric passport. Our automatically learned model is of
	comparable size and complexity of a previous model manually developed
	in the context of testing a passport implementation. Our model can
	be learned within one hour and slightly refines the previous model.},

	Mealy machines can be used for learning I/O automata that are deterministic

	between the I/O automata teacher and the Mealy machine learner, which
	translates concepts from the world of I/O automata to the world of
	Mealy machines, and vice versa. The transducer comes equipped with
	an interface automaton that allows us to focus the learning process

	Uppaal and CPN Tools, and is centered around the DSE Intermediate
	Representation (DSEIR) that is specifically designed to support DSE.
	The toolset architecture allows: (i) easy reuse of models between
	different tools, while providing model consistency, and the combined
	use of these tools in DSE; (ii) domain-specific abstractions to support
	different application domains and easy reuse of tools across domains.},

  abstract = {Fortuna is the first tool for model checking priced probabilistic

	probabilistic and cost features. This is required for addressing
	key design trade-offs that arise in many practical applications such
	as the Zeroconf, Bluetooth, IEEE802.11 and Firewire protocols, protocols
	for sensor networks, and scheduling problems with failures. PPTAs
	are an extension of probabilistic timed automata (PTAs) with cost-rates
	and discrete cost increments on states. Fortuna is able to compute
	the maximal probability by which a class of states can be reached
	under a certain cost-bound (and time bound.) Although this problem
	is undecidable in general, there exists a semi-algorithm that produces
	a non-decreasing sequence of maximal probabilities. This paper enhances
	that algorithm. We compared the performance of Fortuna with existing
	approaches for PTAs. Surprisingly, although PPTAs are more general,
	our techniques exhibit superior performance.},

  abstract = {Modern military operations are complex endeavours involving different
	services and nations, as well as governmental, commercial, non-governmental,
	and international organizations. Each partner may have its own planning
	process and tools. This diversity must be orchestrated to plan the
	overall operation, while maintaining the agility to respond to changing
	situations. We contend that dynamic workflow mechanisms are suited
	to planning military operations. We developed the iTask dynamic workflow
	system that enables the construction of high level multi- user workflow
	applications. Workflows can change in response to dynamic situations,
	new tasks can be spawned by or be dependent on previous tasks, tasks
	can be dynamically adapted. iTask based applications have a web-based
	user interface, allowing external partners to use them without installing
	special software. Moreover, new parties can join them on-the-fly.
	Because of its focus on dynamic processes iTask appears promising
	for development of flexible C2 systems. In this paper we present
	a discussion of the potential of the iTask system for building C2
	systems. We give an overview of the system, and discuss to what extent

	This enables automatic sanity checks by the language compiler, simulation
	of the described semantics to validate the specification, and automatic
	testing of properties of the semantics. We illustrate this technique
	with the well-known example of simple imperative language as well

  abstract = {Workflow management systems (WFMSs) are systems that generate, coordinate
	and monitor tasks performed by human workers in collaboration with
	automated (information) systems. The iTask system (iTasks) is a WFMS
	that uses a combinator language embedded in the pure and lazy functional
	language Clean for the specification of highly dynamic workflows.
	iTask workflow specifications are declarative in the sense that they
	only specify (business) processes and the types of data involved.
	They abstract from user interface and storage issues, which are handled
	generically by the workflow engine. Earlier work has focused on the
	development of the iTask combinator language. The workflow language
	was implemented as an engine that evaluated task combinator expressions
	and generated interactive web pages. Although suitable for its original
	purpose, this architecture has proven to be less so for generating
	practically usable workflow support systems. In this paper we present
	a new implementation of the iTask system that implements the combinator
	library using a service based architecture that exposes the workflow
	and a user friendly Ajax client. Because user interface issues are
	outside the scope of workflow specifications, and cannot be specified
	explicitly, it is crucial that the generic operationalization of
	the declarative interaction primitives is of adequate quality. We
	explain the novel generic libraries we have developed for this purpose.},

  abstract = {Static typing in functional programming languages such as Clean, Haskell,
	and ML is highly beneficial: it prevents erroneous behaviour at run
	time and provides opportunities for optimisations. However, dynamic
	typing is just as important as sometimes types are not known until
	run time. Examples are exchanging values between applications by
	deserialisation from disk, input provided by a user, or obtaining
	values via a network connection. Ideally, a static typing system
	works in close harmony with an orthogonal dynamic typing system;
	not discriminating between statically and dynamically typed values.
	In contrast to Haskellâ€™s minimal support for dynamic typing, Clean
	has an extensive dynamic typing; it adopted MLâ€™s support for monomorphism
	and parametric polymorphism and added the notion of type dependencies.
	Unfortunately, ad-hoc polymorphism has been left out of the equation
	over the years. While both ad-hoc polymorphism and dynamic typing
	have been studied in-depth earlier, their interaction in a statically
	typed functional language has not been studied before. In this paper
	we explore the design space of their interactions.},

	Abstract = {Challenges that are hardly technical, have been reported to occur during enterprise architecture development. To address those caused by ineffective collaboration between architects and organisation stakeholders, we are developing a method referred to as Collaborative Evaluation of Enterprise Architecture Design Alternatives (CEADA). Our method aims at enabling effective execution of collaborative tasks during enterprise architecture creation. In earlier work, initial requirements for CEADA were defined and collaboration engineering was used to design a collaboration process for CEADA. Following design science research guidelines, the initial models (describing the requirements and the design of the collaboration process) were analytically evaluated using structured walkthroughs with enterprise architects. The models were then refined and analytically re-evaluated using structured walkthroughs with skilled facilitators and enterprise architects. This paper presents findings from the analytical re-evaluation of the refined model (describing only the requirements), and reports how it was further refined.},

@inproceedings{2009-Harmsen-Transformations,
	Abstract = {Modern day enterprises are confronted with a variety of challenges,
	forcing them to continuously transform themselves to better meet
	these c hallenges. The diversity of the challenges and the resulting
	desires to transform (parts of) the enterprise, make it desirable
	to align all req uired and desired transformations in such a way
	that they complement each other rather than nullifying, or even undermining,
	each other's effects. Therefore, mature governance of these enterprise
	transformations is absolutely crucial. We will argue that this requires
	a \emph{transformation authority}, being the organisational function
	which is responsible for the governance of enterprise transformations.
	In this chapter, our driving interest is the implementation of mature
	\emph{transformation authorities}. Judging whether a portfolio of
	enterprise transformations is well aligned requires insight into
	the desired overall result, as well as the planned and \emph{achieved}
	effects of the individual transformations. This is what we refer
	to as \emph{informed governance}. In this chapter we will position
	the discipline of \emph{enterprise architecture} (referring to the
	architecture of the enterprise, and not just enterprise-wide IT architecture)
	as the core means to achieve informed governance. We will argue that
	mature governance of enterprises transformations presupposes the
	use of enterprise architecture to direct the portfolio of transformations.
	Our discussions we will be based on theories from management science,
	as well as experiences from our own industrial practices. We will
	also discuss two cases of enterprises involved in the implementation
	of \emph{transformation authorities} and use these to further refine
	our theoretical model. },

@proceedings{2009-Krogstie-EMMSAD,
	Abstract = {The field of information systems analysis and design includes numerous
	information modeling methods and notations (e.g. ER, ORM, UML, DFDs,
	Petri Nets), that are typically evolving. Even with some attempts
	to standardize (e.g. UML for object-oriented design), new modeling
	methods are constantly being introduced, many of which differ only
	marginally from existing approaches. These ongoing changes sig-nificantly
	impact the way information systems are analyzed and designed in practice.
	This workshop focuses on exploring, evaluating, and enhancing current
	informa-tion modeling methods and methodologies. Though the need
	for such studies is well recognized, there is a paucity of such research
	in the literature. The objective of EMMSAD'05 is to provide a forum
	for researchers and practitioners interested in modeling methods
	in systems analysis and design to meet, and exchange research ideas
	and results. EMMSAD'05 is the tenth in a very successful series of
	EMMSAD workshops, previously held in Crete, Barcelona, Pisa, Heidelberg,
	Stockholm, Interla-ken, Toronto, Velden, and Riga. To mark the tenth
	anniversary of the workshop, this year the workshop includes an invited
	keynote address by Prof. Janis Bubenko Jr. that reflects on historical
	trends in information modeling. EMMSAD'05 is jointly sponsored by
	the Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE),
	the International Federation for Information Process-ing Working
	Group 8.1 (IFIP WG 8.1), the International Federation for Information
	Processing Working Group 8.1 (IFIP WG 8.1), the Network of Excellence
	for Inter-operability Research for Networked Enterprises Applications
	and Software (INTEROP), and the Association for Information Systems
	Special Interest Group on Systems Analysis and Design (AIS-SIGSAND).
	This year we had 36 submissions from all over the globe. After an
	extensive re-view process by a distinguished international program
	committee, with each paper re-ceiving three or more reviews, we accepted
	the 21 papers that appear, together with an abstract of the keynote
	address, in these proceedings. Congratulations to the suc-cessful
	authors! },

	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider improving collaborative policy making processes.
	We suggest Collaboration Engineering (CE) as an approach that can
	be useful in enhancing these processes. However, CE needs a theoretical
	basis to guide the design. This basis is provided by the quality
	dimensions and the causal theory. We therefore present a theory that
	provides an understanding of what makes good policies in policy making.
	This understanding should lead to design choices that should be taken
	into account to design quality collaborative policy making processes.
	To determine the quality dimensions of good policies, we use field
	exploratory studies and literature in the policy making domain research.
	Furthermore, we consider cause and effect relationships for these
	quality dimensions to derive the theory.},

	Abstract = {This chapter presents an explicit approach, that is both theory and
	practice driven, to support evaluation and collaboration activities
	when creating enterprise architecture. The approach will be applicable
	in addressing evaluation and collaboration related aspects in two
	primary phases of TOGAF ADM. These two particular phases of TOGAF
	involve activities where collaboration among different key stakeholders
	and enterprise architects is paramount. Moreover based on theoretical
	insights, a collaboration process to facilitate the steps in the
	formulated approach has been developed. Both the approach and the
	process design for its realisation, have been evaluated by exposing
	them to industrial practice. Insights from structured walkthrough
	sessions with experienced enterprise architects are discussed and
	used to enrich the theoretical models. Generally this chapter aims
	at demonstrating how theoretical models, when enriched by experiences
	from industrial practice, can fill the currently existing gap between
	academia and industry, of the lack of a profound analysis of success
	factors for enterprise architecting.},

	Abstract = {Collaborative modeling can enhance productivity and qual- ity of modeling in system development and enterprise engineering projects by helping to construct agreement and a sense of model ownership among stakeholders/modelers. Most of these stakeholders have relatively low ex- pertise in formal modeling; advanced modeler-oriented support for collab- orative modeling is a possible remedy. As a basis for further development of such support (methods, tools), we have carried out a detailed exploratory study of the interaction between modelers, involving diverse aspects of modeling: goal setting, modeling language concepts, planning, etc. Cen- tral in our approach is the study of how collaborative modelers negotiate, set, use, and deal with the various rules/goals governing interactive mod- eling sessions. We describe the conceptual framework and approach used for our analysis, and present findings from a case study which focused on the first phases of a session concerning basic Business Process Modeling. We also compare our findings to some existing work, to demonstrate the relevance of our approach.},

We introduce the AHP and briefly explain its mechanics. We describe the factors we take into consideration, and demonstrate the approach at the hand of a case example we devised based on a semi-realistic collaborative modeling session. The method proposed is to be a key part of a larger setup: a laboratory for the study of operational (i.e. real) modeling sessions and related study and development of methods and tools deployed in them.},

	Abstract = {The art of System Dynamics (SD) modeling lies in discovering and repre-
	senting the feedback processes and other elements that determine
	the dynamics of a system. However, SD shows a lack of means for discovering
	and expressing precise, language-based concepts in domains. Therefore,
	we choose to use Object-Role Mod- eling (ORM) to add high quality
	formal conceptualization to SD modeling and Petri Nets (PNs) to bridge
	the gap between static ORM and Dynamic, flow-like aspects of SD.
	To achieve the integration of these methods, we take a step by step
	approach where we first identify the conceptual link between SD and
	ORM, then the key concepts used in these methods, which we later
	use to derive mappings, transition statements and el- ements. This
	helps us to better understand the underlying concepts, the connections
	between the model structure, and behavior in a sequential manner.},
